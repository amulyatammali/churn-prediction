### Project Description: Churn Prediction Using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)

**Objective:**
The objective of this project is to develop a predictive model using Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to predict employee churn in an organization. Employee churn refers to the phenomenon where employees leave the organization, and predicting it accurately can help HR departments take proactive measures to retain valuable talent.
#
**Dataset:**
- The project utilizes a dataset containing historical employee data, including features such as:
  - Employee demographics (age, gender, education, etc.)
  - Job-related factors (salary, tenure, position, etc.)
  - Performance metrics (evaluations, promotions, etc.)
  - Satisfaction scores (job satisfaction, work-life balance, etc.)
  - Churn status (whether the employee left or stayed)
#
**Steps Involved:**

1) Data Preprocessing
2) Feature Engineering
3) Model Building
4) Model Training and Evaluation
#
**Model Building :**
   - ANN model is build with :
       **Activation Functions:**
                  1) ReLU activation function in hidden layers.
                  2) Sigmoid activation function on output layer.
        **optimizer:**
               - used adam optimizer.
        **cost function:**
               - used binary cross entropy cost function.
# 
**Evaluation:**
    ANN model gave 78 % accuracy score on historical churning dataset.
#
**Benefits:**
- **Early Identification:** Predicting employee churn allows HR departments to identify at-risk employees early and implement retention strategies.
- **Cost Savings:** Reducing turnover can lead to cost savings associated with recruitment, training, and onboarding new employees.
- **Improved Employee Engagement:** By understanding the factors contributing to churn, organizations can improve employee satisfaction and engagement.

#
The project aims to leverage Artificial Neural Networks (ANN) to create a robust predictive model for employee churn, providing valuable insights and actionable recommendations to HR teams to foster a more stable and engaged workforce.
